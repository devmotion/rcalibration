Description: An interface to the Julia packages 'CalibrationErrors.jl' <https://github.com/devmotion/CalibrationErrors.jl>
    and 'CalibrationTests.jl' <https://github.com/devmotion/CalibrationTests.jl>.
    The package allows the estimation of calibration errors such as ECE, SKCE, and UCME,
    and statistical testing of the null hypothesis that a probabilistic predictive model is calibrated.
